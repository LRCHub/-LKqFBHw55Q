```
Darling, I, uh
Your sorry eyes don't bite, uh
If only l- (Uh, uh)
If only I won't lie
No wonder why
You pulled me close, said "You're one of mine"
Before the light hits the air
Desire, read between the lines
I spoke to you, it's like their overused
But it's not like how it used to be, I wanted
Wasted all exhaustion on what you like (Uh)
But it's not like how it used to be, I
Don't think twice (Uh, uh)
I feel there's nothing I could even try to do
(No wonder why)
You pulled me close, said "You're one of mine"
Before the light hits the air
Desire, read between the lines
I spoke to you, it's like their overused
But it's not like how it used to be, I wanted
Wasted all exhaustion on what you like (Uh)
But it's not like how it used to be, I
Write, between the lines
A sorry sight
Oh, it's not like how it used to be, I tried
If only I, if only I, if only I
Desire, read between the lines
I spoke to you, it's like their overused
But it's not like how it used to be, I wanted
Wasted all exhaustion on what you like (Uh)
But it's not like how it used to be, I
